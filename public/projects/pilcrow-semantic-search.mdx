# Pilcrow's Semantic Search

// Image of search

Pilcrow is an AI-sprinkled note taking app, like Apple Notes on steroids.

The design of [Pilcrow](https://pilcrow.xyz) aims to help you create a 'digital garden' - an evergreen notebook where you plant a seed of an idea and watch it grow. 
Existing note apps are more based around project management and work than they are learning. For example, Pilcrow encourages you to write one idea per note. 
This is because the very act of writing a note bubbles up new ideas and helps you discover whilst you write. 
Notes are seperated into lots of seperate ideas which you can connect together.

Creating hundreds, perhaps thousands of notes in most apps can be a nightmare to organise and taxonomise. 
Let's say you write up a new document and store it Folder A. 
You do this because the other items in Folder A follow similar topics. 
This love letter to Cheese and Pickle sandwiches obviously belongs in my 'Lunch' folder. 
There's also a folder called 'Things I love' – doesn't this also fit in there too? 'Okay! I have an idea!' You can make a new folder called 'My favourite lunch' - sorted! Not so fast. Now everything is 'Lunch' AND 'Things I love' need re-organising to see if they now fit into 'My favourite lunch'. 

Endless filing and organising takes lots of precious time away from what you're in this application to do: write. 

The beauty of text-based documents is that they can be searched very easily. 
But search patterns are often poorly built and can be fustrating as they can form a barrier between what the searcher *actually wants* and what the search can turn up with keywords (more on this down below).

## Foundation
The search UI pattern is one of most established and simple looking UI elements. Think of Google's homepage. You can probably draw it from memory it's so simple.
But when you break down what's happening, there's quite a lot of complexity going on under the hood.
When building out search for Pilcrow - I looked at lots of good examples of search patterns on complex-ish products.

// UI shot

It's important that our search adheres to a few principles so that it not only functions properly but provides a useful and pleasurable experience. 
We're putting most of our eggs in this basket as the main way to find notes in your digital garden.

1. **Available**: Search UI should show that it's ready whenever you need it. Users shouldn't need to "search" for the search bar. It's frequently the key entry point to starting a new task or even an escape hatch if the user get's lost.
2. **Helpful**: Obvious but important. Search UI can be daunting because there are almost infinite things you could search. We should help users understand the parameters of what they can search for.
3. **Fast**: Something I've tried to bake right into Pilcrow across the board – search being slow is awful. Expectations of fast, responsive results are common place and create a poor experience if not met.

## Available
The entry point to search is a text input with a <span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 20 20" fill="currentColor" className="inline-block text-primary size-5"><path fillRule="evenodd" d="M9 3.5a5.5 5.5 0 1 0 0 11 5.5 5.5 0 0 0 0-11ZM2 9a7 7 0 1 1 12.452 4.391l3.328 3.329a.75.75 0 1 1-1.06 1.06l-3.329-3.328A7 7 0 0 1 2 9Z" clipRule="evenodd" /></svg></span>
icon to signify it's use case. Sitting at the top of the UI visually indicates that the search covers everything below, in this case – all your Pilcrow notes.

In reality, that input is just a big button. 
When clicked it opens up a dialog view
that sits directly above that initial 'fake input'. This creates the illusion that the dialog UI has surrounded and expanded out of the input. Magic!

Keyboard shortcuts play an important role at increased usability. 
Hitting <kbd className="!font-mono !bg-ui !text-primary !border !border-primary">/</kbd>
and <kbd className="!font-mono !bg-ui !text-primary !border !border-primary">Esc</kbd>
opens and closes the dialog respectively, whilst also automatically focusing on the input on open.

## Fast


## Helpful



## Say what you mean
Semantic search means users can find exactly what they need by it's *semantic meaning* rather than by associated keywords. 
For example, if you want to find a document on tips for 'Training your puppy' – a traditional search will break each word into seperate keywords.
