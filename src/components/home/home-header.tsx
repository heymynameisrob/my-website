      <p className="text-secondary">
        I&apos;m a product designer based in the UK. I&apos;ve been practicing design for
        around 10 years, spending most of that time getting new products off the
        ground.
      </p>
      <p className="text-secondary">
        Currently, I&apos;m leading design at Lantum where I work on workforce
        management tools for healthcare providers.
      </p>
      <p className="text-secondary">
        Away from the screen, I like to travel. Particularly on motorcycles and
        in my camper van. I also enjoy hiking, collecting records, and playing
        guitar. I live in Nottingham with my wife, Harriet and my rabbit, Daisy.
