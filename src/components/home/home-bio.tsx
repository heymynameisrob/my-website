      I design and build professional software. For 10 years, I've worked mostly
      with early-stage companies, particularly in B2B SaaS, Health, Life
      Science, and Commerce. In that time, I've built a reputation for
      considerate, creative design work â€“ backed by purposeful research and
      robust, maintainable code.

    <p className="text-secondary font-sans tracking-normal">
      Away from the screen, I like to travel. Particularly on motorcycles or by
      campervan. I also enjoy hiking, collecting records, and reading. I live in
      the leafy city of Nottingham with my wife, Harriet and my rabbit, Daisy
      (RIP).
