Since joining Lantum, our core focus has been moving into the Secondary Care market. 'Secondary Care' is what we typically think of as healthcare (hospitals, urgent treatment units etc). Previously we've been operating solely in Primary Care, which is primarily GP practices.  

One of core products is our mobile app. This is a handy assistant for clinical staff to keep up to date with their schedule and manage all their shifts in one place. 

Early on, we identified a great deal of leverage we could have moving into SC by creating a great experience for clinicians. With scheduling and staffing software, they're usually left out of the conversation, with most products focused on larger departmental problems which leads to under-performing, poor experiences for frontline staff. They typically have no choice to use that software so little effort is put into making it work for them.

We identified a few workflows we knew clinicians would be doing: Managing their shifts, booking leave, swapping shifts, picking up 'locum' shifts. These latter two came about more recently from some deeper customer research and some strategic manoeuvring.

Largely we've been successful in rolling this out. Almost 100% of our customers have their entire clinical staff using our app, replacing workflows that would have been handled by email, phone, or paper requests (no, seriously). Although it's hard to qualitatively measure the success of a product against a set of workarounds, we've received a huge amount of positive feedback both from clinical staff and department heads. It's a fundamental part of our value prop when we talk to new customers.

This post goes into looking at how added new features, improved the performance and usability, as well as approached building new product within a legacy system that we couldn't fuck up.
