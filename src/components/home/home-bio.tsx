    <p className="font-medium">About</p>
    <p className="text-secondary">I’ve been practicing building products for around 10 years. Spending most of that working in the early-stages, getting new products off the ground.  Most recently, I lead design at Lantum where I worked on building staffing and scheduling software for healthcare, on a mission to save the NHS £1bn a year.</p>
    <p className="text-secondary">Away from the screen, I like to travel. Particularly on motorcycles and in my camper van. I also enjoy hiking, collecting records, and playing guitar. I live in Nottingham with my wife, Harriet and my rabbit, Daisy.</p>
