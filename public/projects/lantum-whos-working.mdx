# See Who's Working

Lantum is a workforce management platform for healthcare organisations, in particular the NHS in the UK. It helps schedule and manage clinical staff, enables clinicians to find extra (locum) work, and allows them to manage their shifts and time-off.

I lead the design, with junior designer Cat, of new product - **See Who's Working**, a list-based overview of a clinicians entire department rota.
Clinicians could see what shifts everyone was working, filter the results, and search for certain staff members.

This was part of our 2023 iniatives: **150 depratments using Lantum everday** and **100% department retention**. 
Overall this product was very successful as not having it was one of our biggest rejections during the sales process. After launch, we rapidly adopted more departments and exceed our yearly target. We recieved great feedback from customers, making SWW a big driver of our user satisfaction rating.

## What is it?

Currently, most clinical staff managed their shifts via a spreadsheet that was created and sent to them by their manager.

This comes with it's own accesibility and experience problems. However, one of the benefits is being able to see not just your own shifts but the entire departments.
For clincians this helps immensely with organising swaps between colleagues, seeing which senior staff are on shift with you, and planning your social time.

At this point, Lantum only provided clinicians with a view of *their own* shifts. Our existing users were straddling both Lantum for it's convient ease-of-use when viewing their own shifts
and their original spreadsheet to see everyone elses.

Not only is this fustrating for clinicians, but also cannibalised our proposition. If we wanted to move entire hospitals onto our system, connecting the scheduling process together so we could improve how the entire process worked
we couldn't achieve that if work was being doubled.

{/* The idea for "See Who's Working" started with feedback from our sales team. They provided our Product team with a list of common objections every quarter.
Chief amongst these was 'Seeing the entire department'. I'm a hug fan of gathering this kind of "research" from other teams in the company as it's low-effort to complete and usually provides some good insight.
However, the results are usually vague. Is this for the manager? Clinician? Does it mean the shfits, or perhaps the allocation?

Myself and Head of Product decided to follow up with some existing and lost prospects to explore this topic more. 
In 5 or so, short 20 minute conversations we uncovered that whilst managers could obviously see and plan an entire deparment rota, clincians only ever recieved their own shifts via the Lantum app.
Both parties we used to working of the same view, so this change albiet a "better experience" lacked a key function that needed to be served.
To work around it, managers were sharing either screenshots of their view or falling back on spreadsheet copies they used before moving to Lantum. */}

## Design goals
When I started work on See Who's Working, I set out a few key design goals that came out of discussions with Head of Product and our sales team, who had been the first people to raise the problem in the first place.
They were as follows:

- **Visiblity:** The core issue here is lack of visiblity and information. Clinicians were not seeing the breadth of information they needed and relying alternative methods to source information.
- **Searchability**: It's easy to not see the wood for the trees. By providing more information, we should be mindful that finding some specific needs to be not only possible but simple.
- **Convience**: One of the key selling points of Lantum over existing solutions is how quick and easy it is to do what you need to do. We need to be considerate we don't spoil that and keep true to what makes Lantum useful.
- **Privacy**: Certain information may want to be hidden from view. Events like compassionate leave may have a private reason attached to it that a clinician may not want displayed to everyone else.

## Impact
- Data (redraw graph) of high 'Engaged Clinicians' using this
- Positive feedback (paraphrase) from clinicians, RM's and sales
