      Iâ€™ve been practicing building products for around 10 years. Spending most

      Away from the screen, I like to travel. Particularly on motorcycles and in
      my camper van. I also enjoy hiking, collecting records, and playing
      guitar. I live in Nottingham with my wife, Harriet and my rabbit, Daisy.
